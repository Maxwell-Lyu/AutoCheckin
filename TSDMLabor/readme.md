# AutoCheckin - TSDMLabor

The <del>AutoCheckin</del> `Laborer` for `TSDM`. 

## How it do labor for you 

BY CHEATING!  

I strongly suggest you to use another labor script that employs `selenium` to really click on ads, which would give `TSDM` profit as this labor should have done.

Okay, here's the real deal:  
+ count `class="npadv"` for `num_adv` which is the number of jobs
+ do `num_adv` times `requests.post(..., {'act': 'clickad'})` to trick the server into believing you are doing jobs one-by-one
+ do `requests.post(..., {'act': 'getcre'})` to trick the server to give you credit

To TSDM developers:   
+ You guys really need to improve the checking logic. From my perspective, your logic works like this:
    + for a session defined using `xxxx_sid`, maintain a counter `clicknum` for jobs done, by increasing it once a `requests.post(..., {'act': 'clickad'})` is done
    + when `requests.post(..., {'act': 'getcre'})` arrives, give credit if `clicknum` is bigger than or equal `advnum`, and reset the timer as 6 hours
+ What you guys can do with this: count the click using a redirection
    + when users click on an ad, they visit a `tsdm` url in a new tab for redirection to the ad
    + increase the counter when the redirection happens

## Environ to set

|name|value|
|-|-|
|TSDM_AUTH|session generated by running [tsdm_session.py](../utility/TSDM/tsdm_session.py) |
|TSDM_SALTKEY|session generated by running [tsdm_session.py](../utility/TSDM/tsdm_session.py) |

The `tsdm_session.py` will generate json files for your convenience, check it before manually set these environs.
